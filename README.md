## Problem Overview

Global security is of prime importance in a weapon filled world and therefore the need to look into the safety of the army personnel and also people living in war prone areas is od the utmost importance.

A Landmine is basically an explosive device hidden underground by the enemy and explodes when any personnel or vehicle steps or drives over it. The Pressure created by the personnel or the vehicle on the ground below which the mine is laid acts as the detonator for the mine explosion. 

The damage caused by the Landmine explosion is fatal and hence detecting landmines becomes necessary before the army personnel or vehicle accidentally steps over it. The major challenge is detecting these landmines without causing any explosion and diffusing them once they are detected.

The process of detecting landmines is technically termed as minesweeping and process of removing or defusing the mines is known as demining or mine clearance. Minesweeping was earlier done using trained animals like dogs and rats but modern methods includes metal detectors and various tooled attached to the vehicles. But any manual intervention of a human is always dangerous.

Robots are used for various applications in industrial area. Robot performs various activities and is becoming more advanced. Thats the reason nowadays Landmine Detection Robotic Vehicles and unmanned robots are used to detect the landmines. Robots are always reliable in terms of perfection in detection and no human life is endangered in the process. An automatic robot, which is capable of detecting buried landmines and taking from their locations, while enabling the operator to control the robot wirelessly from a distance. The detection of the buried mine is done by using metal detectors since most land mines contain metal components. The robot will travel in a zig zag path . The system allows the operator to stay at a safe distance by enabling him to control the robot wirelessly or remotely.



## Existing System



<!-- GPR has been considered as the most promising subsurface sensing technique for landmine clearance operations in combination with a metal detector. This is because of its ability to detect both metallic and nonmetallic landmines. Furthermore, the capability for imaging and post processing of data enables the identification of detected objects. A system combining GPR and a metal detector is commonly called a dual sensor. The system uses the metal detector as the primary sensor for the detection and localization of metal-containing objects, after which it switches to GPR as the secondary sensor for target identification. GPR for landmine detection commonly employs relatively high frequencies in order to detect and/or image small objects near the surface and also to reduce the size of the antennas for easier handling and higher mobility. With high frequencies, GPR becomes more sensitive to the heterogeneity of the media surrounding the object, which results in unwanted scattering in the data. The unwanted scattered waves are commonly referred to as clutter. Clutter degrades the quality of the GPR data and makes their analysis and interpretation difficult. In the case of landmine detection, a false analysis or interpretation of the data may lead to an accidental detonation -->


## Proposed System
A system which involves a user interface , server and a robot to detect Landmines in a given area autonomously.
The Landmine detecting robots are designed to cover maximum possible area of landmine field for detection of landmines. The detected landmines along with scanned and leftover area are represented on a visual map

## Key Features and Scope
- Automated path finding
- GPS based navigation
- Landmine detection using PI
- Visualization of data maps
